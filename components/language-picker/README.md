# Language Picker

Originally designed for Bloom Desktop.

`language-picker/common/find-language` contains the logic for fuzzy-searching for languages, suitable to be published on its own and usable by various frontends. The database of languages is based on [langtags.json](https://github.com/silnrsi/langtags) and also makes use of [langtags.txt](https://github.com/silnrsi/langtags/blob/master/doc/tagging.md#langtagstxt). Also has various methods for modifying the search results to handle special cases (e.g. sign languages and very common languages). Currently, corner cases in the search results are adjusted as makes sense for Bloom's use cases by `defaultSearchResultModifier` which

- ensures the English result comes up on top if the user starts typing "English"
- ensures the French result comes up on top if the user starts typing "French", "Francais" or "fran√ßais"
- simplifies the English and French cards to remove the regions lists and most alternative names
- removes certain entries from langtags.json that don't represent specific extant human languages, such as zxx (no linguistic content) or ang (old english)
- filters out Braille from the script options, as well as script codes that do not refer to specific relevant scripts

searchResultModifiers.ts contains various helper methods which others can use to put together modifiers appropriate for their use cases.

`language-picker/react/language-chooser-react-mui` is a React component which uses the `language-picker/common/find-language` logic to present a language picker.

## Development

First, set up nx if you haven't already. (See [README.md](../../README.md)).

We recommend installing nx globally, but if you haven't, you can just prefix all the commands with `npx`

To locally run a hot-reloading demo of the mui language chooser: `nx dev @ethnolib/language-chooser-react-mui`

If you make changes to the `find-language` package, you will need to run `nx build @ethnolib/find-language` every time for the frontend (e.g. react mui language chooser demo) to pick up those changes. TODO NX should have a way to make changes in find-language hot-reload in language-chooser-react-mui but I haven't figured it out yet.

If you make changes to [langtagProcessing.ts](common/find-language/langtagProcessing.ts), run `npm run find-language/common/langtag-processing` to update [languageData.json](common/find-language/languageData.json).

## Unit tests

Language picker uses vitest for unit tests.
`nx test @ethnolib/find-language`
